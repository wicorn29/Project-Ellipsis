# About the Tool
<p>The root tool is based off of Framaroot. It has been modified to work best on the Verizon Ellipsis 7.</p>
<p>Here are the instructions on how to root your Ellipsis 7.</p>

#  Root Instructions
<p>If you haven't enabled USB debugging, now is a good time.</p>

<p>To get started, download the file linked below</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wicorn29/Project-Ellipsis/raw/main/Root/PootyRooty.apk">ShootyRooty.apk</a></p>

<p>Next, install that apk file on your Ellipsis. You may do this any way you desire.</p>

<p>After you have installed it and then opened it, you will see some options. In the drop-down list on the top left, make sure "Grow Roots" is checked. If at any point you want to unroot your device, click the obvious "Kill Roots" option.</p>
